However, the desserts, despite their elegant presentation, failed to meet expectations in terms of taste and were overly sweet. The restaurant's atmosphere is trendy and modern, but the pricing can be on the higher side. GoodMunch is a decent choice for taco enthusiasts, but the desserts may leave you wanting more.",

The affordability of the menu items is a definite plus, making it a budget-friendly option for pizza and burger lovers.

The presentation of the sushi was impressive, showcasing the chef's attention to detail. The desserts were equally delightful, offering a satisfyingly sweet ending to the meal.
